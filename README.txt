* About

wxDimensions is modern wxWidgets bindings for the D programming language based on wxD.

wxWidgets is a cross-platform GUI toolkit, which supports Windows,
Mac OS X, *nix-like OSs - such as Linux,FreeBSD with X11/Motif/GTK.

wxDimensions is delivered work from wx.NET bindings 0.7.2 (wxWidgets 2.6.1) and wxD.
It would work compiled with the latter versions of wxWidgets.

It is composed of two parts:
   + wxc is a C++ library which exposes the wxWidgets API as a 
     collection of D friendly functions.
   + wxd is a library written in D which parallels the wxWidgets 
     class hierarchy, ported from wx.NET.

0.02 (bero)
some bug fix and missing C function implement.
more example works.
fix event
change multiple constructor to single constructor with default args

 return struct func to void func(struct*)
 in my view, D's extern (C) and C++'s extern "C" is not compatible when return struct
most example work.

Under development.
Currently only checked on Windows platform.
Some example program crashed.


* How to compile

** build wxWidgets

- get wxWidgets-2.6.x
- extract
- regenerate, if needed
windows: (Digital Mars)
    cd build\bakefiles
    bakefile_gen
unix: (GNU)
    ./autogen.sh
- compile and install
windows: (Digital Mars)
  cd build\msw
  make -f makefile.dmc
unix: (GNU)
  ./configure
  make
  sudo make install
macosx: (Xcode)
  cd src; open wxWindows.xcodeproj and "Build" /or/
  xcodebuild -target dynamic -configuration Deployment

** build wxD

- extract
- compile
windows:
  set WXDIR=<path to wxWidgets>
  make all test
unix:
  make all test
  sudo make install
macosx: (Xcode)
  set WXWIN=<path to wxWidgets>
  xcodebuild -alltargets
freebsd:
  gmake all test
  su -c "make install"
bud: (see http://dsource.org/projects/build/)
  make bud
rebuild: (see http://dsource.org/projects/dsss/wiki/Rebuild)
  make rebuild
DSSS: (see http://dsource.org/projects/dsss/)
  dsss build
  dsss install
Code::Blocks: (see http://codeblocks.org)
  codeblocks --build wxc.cbp
  codeblocks --build wxd.cbp

* Linking

When compiling programs using wxD, you need to make sure to include all of:
wxd (D linkage), wxc (C linkage), wxWidgets (C++ linkage), stdc++ libraries

Unix systems can use the output from `wx-config --libs` to determine wx libs.
Build systems should set up pragmas, in wx.libs module, by using "make build".

* Naming rules

- constant/enum wxXXXX is wxXXXX
- class/method wxXXX is XXX
- method SetXXX/GetXXX change to property XXX,
  but if XXX is class name, change first character to lower case 
  ex: void SetColour(wxColour)/wxColor GetColour() -> void colour(Color)/Colour colour()

Point,Size,Rect is native D struct instead of wxWidgets struct.
in D, struct can't have constructor.
for convenience, use constructor like function:
 Point Point(int x,int y);
 Size  Size(int w,int h);
 Rect  Rect(int x,int y,int w,int h)
(Rect is an alias of Rectangle)

    C++ API passing array and number of element change to passing array only.
    D array knows number of element.
    ex:

    wxListBox(wxWindow *parent, wxWindowID id,
            const wxPoint& pos = wxDefaultPosition,
            const wxSize& size = wxDefaultSize,
    --->    int n = 0, const wxString choices[] = NULL,
            long style = 0,
            const wxValidator validator = wxDefaultValidator,
            const wxString& name = wxListBoxNameStr)

    ListBox(Window parent, WindowID id,
            Point pos = wxDefaultPosition,
            Size size = wxDefaultSize,
    -->     string choices[] = null,
            long style = 0,
            Validator validator = wxDefaultValidator,
            string name = wxListBoxNameStr)
   
* Platforms

When compiling wxD programs, you need to tell it which version of
wxWidgets that you want (i.e. what platform you are targetting)

Your platform name should be available in the file "wxc/PLATFORM".
(Build systems such as Bud/Rebuild will have it set by "wx.libs")

Here are the main supported ones:
Windows XP     version=__WXMSW__
Linux/GTK+     version=__WXGTK__
Macintosh      version=__WXMAC__

For checking the wx platform at runtime, see the wxPlatform class.

* Encodings

There are two ways to compile wxWidgets, as "ansi" or as "unicode"
The former uses "char" characters, and the latter uses "wchar_t".

Your encoding name should be available in the file "wxc/ENCODING".
(Build systems such as Bud/Rebuild will have it set by "wx.libs")

wx-config:     DFLAGS:
--unicode=no   version=ANSI
--unicode=yes  version=UNICODE

The alias "string" is used in wxD, for char[] strings (UTF-8 format)

* Licence

wxD is licensed under the wxWindows Licence which is LGPL, with a
special exception to allow distributing as a static linked binary.

This is a solution that satisfies those who wish to produce GPL'ed
software with wxD, and also those producing proprietary software.
